# Online Stella Slate

A website replacing the board game [Stella](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/329845/stella-dixit-universe/ratings?rated=1&comment=1)'s kind of crappy whiteboard 'slate' and marker with an easier online version.

Play the game as usual, but instead of writing on the whiteboard, get all the players to go to https://stella.tornato.dev/ on their phones (it's a horizontal site), and hopefully it's self-explanatory.

This *isn't* an online remake of the game itself. You'll need to have the game and cards to play.
